- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Edmanuel Lorenzo,
- I live in Houston and I am working on getting into the tech industry. For the past couple of years I have been working on a few personal projects.
- In 2018, I started an Ice Cream shop with an EscapeRoom. After a couple of months into it, I sold my ownership. Then I went into the puzzle industry and
- started creating puzzles(in spanish) in a box, where people were able to play the game and solve puzzles in the comfort of house (During the Pandemic). I still spend 
- some time in it, you can go visit www.bombipr.com (I created and edited the content of the website using shopify). 
- I love sports, especially baseball which I player for about 16 years of my life. I current train and coach youth baseball here in Texas.
- I also got a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Masters degree in Finance. Yes, I used to work as a Mechanical Engineer for a couple of years
- but I decided to venture out and explore my entreprenurial side. After doing all this, I went and got my Masters in Finance. 

- Its been quite a ride but the one thing I have learned most is about myself. I adapt very quickly, I learn fast, I am a self-learner and everything I do, 
  I do it with 100% Effort.


- Iâ€™m interested in website and app development, I have been wanting to get my foot on the door and I am working on getting there.
- Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS . I have been reading and learning from free online certifications, YouTube, and web browsing.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any startup Project, any tech firm, any team looking for an extra hand with my skills.

- Thank you, 
- Edmanuel
